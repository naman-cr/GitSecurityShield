## Project Overview

**GitSecurityShield** is a security-focused application designed for organizations and developers to monitor and manage vulnerabilities within their GitHub repositories. It leverages GitHubâ€™s security tools to identify issues, stores data dynamically with Elasticsearch, and automates task creation in Jira to prioritize security fixes.

---

## Features

- **GitHub Security Integration**: Supports Secret Scan, Code Scan, and Dependabot to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Elasticsearch Storage**: Stores findings dynamically, creating custom indexes per organization for efficient querying and retrieval.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Manages user access with secure permissions using an SQL database.
- **Kafka-Driven Processing**: Uses Kafka to handle data flow between services efficiently.
- **Automated Jira Integration**: Creates Jira tickets by vulnerability severity to streamline remediation workflows.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](https://link-to-architecture-diagram-image)

The application follows a modular architecture with microservices that handle scanning, indexing, permissions, and ticketing independently. This setup ensures scalability, efficient processing, and secure data management.

### Key Components:
- **Frontend (React)**: Provides an intuitive user interface for scanning, monitoring vulnerabilities, and managing access.
- **Backend (Java Spring Boot)**: Manages API requests, connects to databases, and controls core application logic.
- **Data Processing (Kafka)**: Ensures reliable communication and data handling between services.
- **Data Storage**: Uses Elasticsearch for indexing findings and an SQL database for user roles and permissions.
- **Jira Integration**: Automatically creates and assigns issues in Jira based on vulnerability severity.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: Elasticsearch for scan data, SQL for RBAC
- **Data Streaming**: Kafka
- **Issue Tracking**: Jira integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Java Development Kit (JDK) 11+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)
[SQL Database Setup] (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

**Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GitSecurityShield.git
   cd GitSecurityShield
```

**Backend Setup**
- Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
```
- Build the project with Maven:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
- Configure `application.properties` with database and Elasticsearch settings.
  
**Frontend Setup**
- Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
- Start the frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

**Start Kafka and Elasticsearch Services**
- Follow setup instructions for Kafka and Elasticsearch, ensuring they are running before starting the application.

  
### Configuration
- **Database Configuration:** In `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`, configure your SQL and Elasticsearch connection details.
- **Kafka Topics:** Create required Kafka topics for producers and consumers.
- **Jira Integration:** Set Jira API credentials and URL in the configuration file under the jira section to enable ticket automation.
- **GitHub API:** To enable repository scanning, add GitHub API credentials in application.properties.
  
### Usage Guide
- **User Authentication:** Login using your credentials. New users can sign up if permitted by the admin.
- **Link GitHub Repositories:**
  - Navigate to the "Repositories" tab and link repositories.
  - Start a scan by clicking the "Scan" button.
- **View Vulnerabilities:**
  - Results are displayed in the dashboard, categorized by severity.
  - Click on each finding for detailed information and remediation steps.
- **Issue Tracking:**
  - Based on the severity, Jira tickets are automatically created.
  - View ticket status and details directly from the application.
- **Admin Dashboard:**
  - Manage user roles and access permissions via the Admin dashboard.
